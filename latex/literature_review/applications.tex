The technologies presented here are the, or at least was, the cutting edge technologies for ML and
they result in numerous usages in the field. 

Tensor Processing Units were used for Deep Language Recommendation Models which is used by big companies, like Meta/Facebook and Google. \cite{b9}
The TPUs are also available as cloud services for the public to use typically used for training Large Language Models.

The NVIDIA A100 GPU is a versatile accelerator with a wide range of applications. It is widely used for training and deploying large-scale deep learning models, accelerating a variety of machine learning workloads, and enabling high-performance scientific computing. The A100's capabilities also
 make it a compelling choice for powering data centers, cloud computing platforms, and edge computing devices.
